        <p>
          Smol Angular Snippets is a personal project dedicated to experimenting
          with Angular and showcasing various code snippets. The goal is to
          provide simple, reusable components that demonstrate the power and
          flexibility of Angular, all without relying on any UI frameworks.

        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
          Smol Angular Snippets began as a sandbox for exploring Angular's
          capabilities and sharing the resulting code with the developer
          community. As new challenges and ideas emerged, the project evolved
          into a collection of practical, bite-sized snippets designed to make
          Angular development more accessible and enjoyable.

            With a passion for coding and a love for Angular, I created Smol
            Angular Snippets to experiment with new ideas and share my findings
            with others. This project is a reflection of my journey through the
            Angular ecosystem.
